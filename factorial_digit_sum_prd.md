# Factorial Digit Sum Calculator - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

### Purpose
Develop a simple Python CLI application that calculates the factorial of a number and then computes the sum of digits in the resulting factorial. This application will serve as a teaching tool to demonstrate different programming paradigms to computer science students.

### Educational Objectives
- Demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Show evolution to Functional Programming paradigms
- Illustrate Clean Code principles
- Demonstrate SOLID principles implementation

## Problem Statement

Calculate the factorial of 100 (100!) and find the sum of all digits in the resulting number.

**Example**: 
- 10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800
- Sum of digits in 3,628,800 = 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Factorial Calculation**: Calculate factorial of 100 (100!)
2. **Digit Sum Calculation**: Sum all individual digits in the factorial result
3. **Result Display**: Present the final digit sum to the user
4. **CLI Interface**: Run as a command-line application
5. **No Parameters**: Application should run without accepting command-line arguments

### Input/Output Specifications
- **Input**: None (hardcoded to calculate 100!)
- **Output**: 
  - Display the factorial value (optional for educational purposes)
  - Display the sum of digits in the factorial
  - Clear, formatted output for classroom demonstration

### Example Output
```

  - `ResultDisplay`: Handles output formatting
  - `Application`: Main application orchestrator
- **Key OOP Concepts to Demonstrate**:
  - Encapsulation (private methods, data hiding)
  - Single Responsibility Principle (each class has one job)
  - Composition (classes working together)
  - Method organization and class structure

### Code Complexity Requirements
- **Size**: 50-100 lines of code (optimal for classroom review)
- **Complexity**: Sufficient to demonstrate meaningful OOP concepts

   - Open/Closed Principle
   - Liskov Substitution Principle
   - Interface Segregation Principle
   - Dependency Inversion Principle

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Execution time should be under 1 second for classroom demonstration
- Memory usage should be reasonable for educational environment

### Usability
- Simple execution: `python factorial_digit_sum.py`
- Clear, readable output
- No configuration required

### Maintainability
- Code should be easily refactored for different paradigms
- Clear separation of concerns
- Modular design allowing easy modification

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Python 3.8+ required
- No external dependencies beyond standard library
- CLI-only interface (no GUI)
- No command-line parameters accepted

### Educational Constraints
- Code must be reviewable in 10-15 minutes
- Each class/method should have a clear, demonstrable purpose
- Structure should facilitate easy transformation to other paradigms

## Success Criteria
